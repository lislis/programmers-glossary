      # The Programmer's Glossary

      ---

      # The talk formaly known as The Progammer's Zoo

      ---

      # The talk soon to be known The Monkey, the Duck, the Yak in the bike shed

      ---

      # Naming things is hard

      ---

      One of two hard things

      ---


      Like cache validation

      ---

      and one-off errors

      ---

      which brings us to the point

      ---

      Programmers have their own secret language

      ---

      people not in the know have a disadvantage

      or juniors

      or project manager

      or new hires

      ---

      awkward situations

      miscommunication

      ---

      So here are some more or less often used terms
      so that you know them
      and so that you can explain them to others
      using non-technical terms

      ---

      Spoiler: there are not 10

      ---

      # Down the rabbit hole

      bizarre world

      ---

      # Yak shaving

      ---

      # Red herring

      ---

      # Bikeshedding

      ---

      # Duck typing

      ---

      # Rubber ducking

      ---

      # Monkey Patching

      ---

      Think of the language you use
      Words are powerful
      They can include and discriminate

      ask to make sure you're understood correctly
      explain beforehand to approach introverts

      If you think reading code is hard
      try reading other people
