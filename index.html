      class: white-text

      # Monkey Patching

      Everything in Ruby is mutable. So you can overwrite methods of eg of 3rd party libraries (or the standard library) to fix things.

      ---

      And that's it.

      ---

      ## What I want you to take away

      --

      Be aware of the language and the words you use.

      --

      Words are powerful, they can include and exclude.

      ---

      ## What you can do

      --

      Make sure you're understood correctly, explain phrases.

      --

      If you don't understand a term, ask.

      ---

      Cultivate a culture where asking is always ok.

      ---

      If you think reading code is hard,
      try reading other people.
